# Navelicious

Sometimes you need that fancy navbar! Similar to the stripe.com top navbar but it creates a slider when you have many items.

# Navelicious

I built this component to use in one project but I ended up not using so I decided to make it open source.

# Demo & Documentation

https://navelicious.now.sh/

# Development

First install all the dependencies:
`npm install` or 'yarn'

To run the project and see the naveliciouc in action just run:
`npm run start` or 'yarn start'

All the navelicious components live inside the `site/src/navelicious` folder
